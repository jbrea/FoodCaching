This repository contains the code for the article

**"Computational models of episodic-like memory in food-caching birds"**
Johanni Brea, Nicola S. Clayton, Wulfram Gerstner

This repository contains four submodules. Clone all of them with the command
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCaching`.

Alternatively, the modules can be cloned individually, e.g.
`git clone https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCaching/FoodCachingExperiments.jl`.

See [FoodCachingExperiments](https://github.com/jbrea/FoodCachingExperiments.jl)
if you want to simulate your model on published experimental protocols.

The code is tested with the [julia 1.7](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
